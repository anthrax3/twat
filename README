   * cURL                (http://curl.haxx.se/)

Step 5: killall twatc twats

====== External Libraries ======
For getting tweets from twitter, the twitter API Was used. This
API Uses JSON (http://json.org/) as its data format. Since I
did not want to write a parser myself, a stripped down version of
the excellent cJSON library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cjson/)
was used to do so.
